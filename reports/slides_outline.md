## Presentation Tips

### Visual Design
- Use consistent color scheme aligned with your organization
- Limit text per slide (6x6 rule: max 6 bullets, max 6 words per bullet)
- Use high-quality visualizations from your analysis
- Include your organization/project logo on each slide

### Content Guidelines
- Focus on insights, not methods (unless technical audience)
- Use business language, not jargon (unless technical audience)
- Tell a story: Problem → Analysis → Insights → Actions
- Emphasize value and impact

### Delivery
- Practice timing (1-2 minutes per slide)
- Prepare for questions on:
  - Why these methods were chosen
  - Alternative interpretations
  - Implementation details
  - Cost/benefit analysis
- Have backup slides ready:
  - Detailed methodology
  - Additional visualizations
  - Statistical details
  - Code samples

### Audience-Specific Adjustments

**For Technical Audience**:
- Include more methodological details on slides 4-5
- Add algorithm parameters and tuning process
- Show code snippets or architecture diagrams
- Discuss computational complexity

**For Business Audience**:
- Focus heavily on slides 12-13 (insights and recommendations)
- Use business metrics and ROI language
- Minimize technical jargon
- Emphasize practical implications

**For Mixed Audience**:
- Keep technical details in speaker notes
- Use analogies to explain complex concepts
- Provide both high-level and detailed views
- Offer to go deeper on request

---

**Notes:**
- Save key detailed analysis for appendix/backup slides
- Have your notebooks ready to demo if asked
- Practice transitions between slides
- Time yourself and adjust content as needed
